Part of my [two weeks on the couch](http://weblog.fredalger.net/) effort, the first in a series of CouchApps and CouchDB-related goodness done here, from my couch.

Not too functional, yet, but so far:
* [RedLaser Custom App Support](http://redlaser.com/apps) &mdash; hit this app


Planned features:
* Combined search/data entry field.  If you've entered the book, scanning the barcode will bring it up.  If it's new, it'll start you entering data.
* Photo uploads.  Take a picture while cataloging.

Yep, it's gonna be pretty spartan, but that's what you get for throwing your books in a bucket.  My hope is that some other people will see the potential here, roll some things into their own apps, or just join up and help me hack on stuff.

Install

You're on your own here.  It's a CouchApp, so you'll need [couchapp](http://couchapp.org) and Python to get started and push it into a CouchDB.

Demo

Coming soon to [a geeky website near you](http://bookbucket.fredalger.net), just as soon as I get it reasonably functional and secure and figure out how to proxy to it from nginx.
